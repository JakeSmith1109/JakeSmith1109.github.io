    <h1>Outside and Opposite Hitter</h1>
    <div id="myDiv">
        <p> Outside hitter is the most common position in volleyball, as in most lineups, there are always two of them on the court. </p>
        <p> In some circumstances a defensive specialist will substitute in for one of the outside hitters to pass for them in the back row is the hitter does not have the strongest passing and defensive skills. </p>
        <p> However, even in the front row, this position has both <i>offensive and defensive responsibilities.</i> Outside hitters not only get approximately 60% of the offensive hitting opportunities, but they also have to put up a solid block on about <b>10%</b> of defensive opportunities.</p>
        <p> Opposite hitters have the exact same responsibilities as outside hitters, but on the <b>opposite</b> side of the court. They also only get about 10% of the hitting opportunities but are a part of 60% of defensive block attempts.</p>
